This is the documentation of what the project supports and is capable of doing.

## Game Map Creation

There are a couple components that go into creating a working map. It is not complicated if you already know what you want to impliment, so I would suggest having an idea of what to make before trying to make it in Unity.
Once you know what you want to make these are the steps required to have a working Game Map:
  - Make Node Types using the _NodeTypeMaker_ tool
  - Plan out roughly what the map will look like
  - Make the map in Unity using the _NodeMakerWindow_ tool
