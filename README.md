It includes the following features:

  - Customization of each node in the map
  - Extendable Player class that works with the Game Map out-of-box
  - Customizable turn system
  - Movement on Game Map

You have full access to source code when you buy the assset on [insert asset store link] and are encouraged to modify the code to fit your exact needs. If you have any issues contact me at <fatherboard28@gmail.com>
