# BoardgameDevTool

This project is meant to serve as a spring board for any game that has a boardgame-like gamespace. For example: Mario Party. 
It includes the following features:
  - Game Map creation
  - Customization of each node in the map
  - Extendable Player class that works with the Game Map out-of-box
  - Customizable turn system
  - Movement on Game Map

You have full access to source code when you buy the assset on [insert asset store link] and are encouraged to modify the code to fit your exact needs. If you have any issues contact me at <fatherboard28@gmail.com>

## Game Map Creation

There are a couple components that go into creating a working map. It is not complicated if you already know what you want to implement, so I would suggest having an idea of what to make before trying to make it in Unity.
Once you know what you want to make these are the steps required to have a working Game Map:
  - Make Node Types using the _NodeTypeMaker_ tool
  - Plan out roughly what the map will look like
  - Make the map in Unity using the _NodeMakerWindow_ tool

### Making Node Types

In order to do this open the _NodeTypeMaker_ tool. On the top of the Unity Editor go to the _BoardGameUtils_ tab and select _NodeTypeMaker_ from the list of windows.
It should bring up the following window:
